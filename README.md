# WilliamKiddy - The Theme Artisan

Ahoy, fellow coders! 👨‍💻⚓  
Welcome to **WilliamKiddy**, where creativity meets the command line. I'm passionate about crafting stunning Unix themes that make your terminal experience both beautiful and functional. Join me on my journey through cozy colors, smooth gradients, and themes that transform your workflow into an adventure! 🏴‍☠️

### **Current Projects:**

A warm, soft theme that wraps your terminal in a cozy cocoon. Perfect for those cool nights spent working, with gentle hues that make coding feel like a hug.

#### 💨 **Puffica**
A light and airy theme with pastel tones, designed to give your terminal a fresh, breezy atmosphere. Ideal for those who want a calming, almost "floating" experience while working.

#### 💎 **Velura**
A luxurious theme with rich, velvety textures and deeper tones. For those who prefer a darker, more sophisticated atmosphere in their terminal.

#### 🌙 **Lunara** *(Light Theme)*
A serene, moonlit theme with soft shades of blue and silver. Inspired by the calm of the night sky, **Lunara** is a perfect light theme that keeps things gentle on your eyes, even after long hours of coding.
